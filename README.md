# Pet-Awesome Marketing Email

I was hired to build this marketing email for Pet-Awesome pet products. 

The finished product that I ended up using was the file called email.html.

## Process for emailing from gmail and chrome:
1. copy html document from plain text editor
2. Open gmail
3. Insert some placeholder text like "PPP"
4. Highlight placeholder text. Right click and inspect.
5. On the highlighted portion in chrome editor tools, click edit as html
6. find placeholder text and carefully replace with pasted html code.
7. Send email

Note: I had to move the background from the body tag or it wouldn't show up in email. I put it in the table element that body enclosed.
